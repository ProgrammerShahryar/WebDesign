# Q2. 
Proximity = positioning related items together, like the navigation links within the .navbar, the content within the .gridOne, or the elements within sections like #bio, #skillsOne, and #contactOne.
Contrast = creates visual interest and helps differentiate elements. My website uses color contrast effectively, like the contrast between --firstColor and --secondColor for backgrounds, making the navbar and buttons stand out against the background.
Typography = using font family ('Rubik Regular') for different text elements ensures consistency and readability across the website.
Alignment = my website utilizes alignment to create a balanced layout, especially evident in the grid system used for arranging content (grid-template-columns, grid-column properties).
Repetition = my website maintains consistency in the use of colors, font styles, and layout across different sections and elements, providing a cohesive user experience.
# Q3. 
Semantic HTML elements (<nav>, <header>, <main>, <footer>) are used appropriately, which help screen readers and other assistive technologies in understanding the structure of the content.
Headings (<h1> through <h4>) are used hierarchically and logically, ensuring a clear structure and facilitating navigation for users relying on screen readers.
Descriptive link texts (<a> tags) are used providing context to users navigating through screen readers.
Navigable elements, like links and form fields, are accessible via keyboard navigation, ensuring users can interact with the site without a mouse.
Images contain descriptive alt attributes, providing meaningful information for users who rely on screen readers or users with images disabled.
The website's responsiveness ensures that content is accessible and usable across different devices!
Strategies: Semantic HTML, Proper Heading Structure, Meaningful Link Text, Keyboard Accessibility, Alternative Text for Images, and Responsive Design.
# Q4.
